# Creating Windows GUI Apps with C# & .NET

## FAQ

### What is C#?

C# is a programming language that is designed by Microsoft for building a variety of applications that run on the .NET Framework. C# is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented. The many innovations in C# enable rapid application development while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages.

### What is the .NET framework, anyway?

.NET is a software framework designed by Microsoft used to make applications primarily on the Windows platform. It has many, many features. Some of its most praised features are its large class library and language interoperability (e.g., a programmer can code a class in C# and a Visual Basic programmer can import the class and use it)! .NET's Framework Class Library (FCL) and Common Language Runtime (CLR) provides a combination of things like security, memory management, exception handling, user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application development, and more!
